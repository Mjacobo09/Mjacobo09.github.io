## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3 

  I enjoyed lab three because the program we created was beneficial, for part-1 of this lab it helped determine how many calories a person should take depending on their height and weight.  I also enjoyed part 2 because we were able to calculate how many days are between certain dates, it could be dates from 1200 to 2500 which was pretty cool and interesting because sometimes people want to know exactly how many days are between certain dates which also made this program beneficial. 

* Lab 12

  I enjoyed lab 12 because we were able to create a gif, which involved animations. I was a fan of this because I’ve animated some things before so it was cool seeing how we can also use code to animate things, hopefully in the future I will be able to create a website on my own, because I have seen that people create websites with their codes. 

* Lab 4

  I enjoyed working on lab 4 because it had to do with different units of measurements and also creating our first little guessing game. I found part-1 of this lab very useful because being able to convert different units of measurements into other ones is useful to know especially if you were to be cooking or baking things and let's say you don’t have tbsp but you have teaspoons, so you can know how many teaspoons are needed for a certain amount of tbsp.
